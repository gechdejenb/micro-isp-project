# Micro ISP Project

> A comprehensive solution for managing and optimizing Internet Service Provider operations using AI, blockchain technology, and network simulation.

## Overview

This project implements a modern approach to ISP management by combining:
-  Network simulation and monitoring
-  AI-driven bandwidth optimization with OpenAI GPT-4
-  Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) for decentralized backend
-  Real-time analytics dashboard

## Getting Started

###  Prerequisites
-  Python 3.12+
-  Node.js
-  Mininet
-  DFINITY SDK (dfx) for Internet Computer development
-  OpenAI API access

###  Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Set up the ISP Simulator:
```bash
cd isp-simulator
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the ICP backend:
```bash
cd icp-backend
dfx start --background
dfx deploy
```

4. Set up the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

5. Configure AI services:
```bash
cd ai-services
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Configure your OpenAI API key in .env file
```

## 🎮 Usage

1. Start the network simulation:
```bash
cd isp-simulator
sudo python network_simulator.py
```

2. Start the local ICP replica (if not already running):
```bash
cd icp-backend
dfx start
```

3. Run the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

4. Monitor the network through the dashboard at `http://localhost:5173`
